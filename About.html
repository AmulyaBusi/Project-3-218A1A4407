           <h1>Physical Fitness</h1>
            <p>Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more specifically, 
               the ability to perform aspects of sports, occupations, and daily activities. 
              Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper nutrition, moderate-vigorous physical exercise,
               and sufficient rest along with a formal recovery plan.
            Before the Industrial Revolution, fitness was defined as the capacity to carry out the day's activities
              without undue fatigue or lethargy. However, with automation and changes in lifestyles, 
         physical fitness is now considered a measure of the body's ability to function efficiently and effectively in work and leisure 
       activities, to be healthy,
             to resist hypokinetic diseases, to improve immune system function, and to meet emergency situations</p><br>
